Possible project subjects:

1.) Monte Carlo
	* to study equilibrium properties of a sys


2.) Molecular Dynamics -giordano text notes pg 230 (245)
	* complimentary to monte carlo instead of EQ we look at how fast sys will go to EQ
	* Simulate dynamics using microscopic equitions of motion
	* Like Euler's method but Euler has too much error with each step
	* Verlet Method employed
		* see appendix one 
	* solves verlet equations for every particle in the system
	* use periodic boundary conditions
	* have to initialize particle position and velocities before using verlet equations
	
	
	* This project seems feasible and very applicable to my summer research. 


3.) Fourier Transform
