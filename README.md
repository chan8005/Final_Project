This project will implement Molecular Dynamics (MD) to simulate 8937 molecules of water placed in a sphereical simulation box. Trajectory data at temperatures of 200,250,300,350, and 400  will be taken for analysis. The main purpose of this project is to evlauate the rate at which density changes with respect to radius and compared at different temperatures. 

File named WaterSimulationCode provides code needed for running the simulations. This code was adapted from OpenMM and Dr.Kevin E Johnson from Pacific University. 

The file named project.ipynb uses packages from math, numpy, and matplotlib.pylab for analysis of the trajectory files obtained from the simulations.
